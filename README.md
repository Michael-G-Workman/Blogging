Example ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC Web Application with Entity Framework

This is an example MVC application using ASP.NET Core 2.2, it uses database first Entity Framework,
I also added data annotations to the EF model classes so a name other than the table name could
be used for the DbSet variables in the Context file. This solution uses LocalDB SQL Server,
But can also work with SQL Express, a free version of SQL Server made by Microsoft.

Before running this ASP.NET solution, be sure to run the BLOGGING_Create.sql file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
or in Visual Studio. This script is located in the SQL Server repository.

This Solution is freely distributable under terms of the MIT Open Source License.
